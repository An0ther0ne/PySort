    +++ Case 01:
    This is built in Python sort function
    Sorting tests : 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50, Passed.
    Time elapsed: 0.004 seconds.

    +++ Case 02:
    Bubble sorting algorithm -- is a simplest of sorting algorithms.
    Perfomance: O(n**2)
    Sorting tests : 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50, Passed.
    Time elapsed: 0.790 seconds.

    +++ Case 03:
    Insertion sorting algorithm -- standard realisation
    Perfomance: O(n**2)
    Sorting tests : 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50, Passed.
    Time elapsed: 0.378 seconds.

    +++ Case 04:
    Insertion sorting algorithm -- my custom Python-specific realisation
    Perfomance: O(n**2)
    The best performance time among insertions algorithms in python
    Sorting tests : 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50, Passed.
    Time elapsed: 0.082 seconds.

    +++ Case 05:
    Gnome sorting algorithm
    Perfomance: O(n**2)
    Sorting tests : 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50, Passed.
    Time elapsed: 0.792 seconds.
    
    +++ S U M A R Y +++
    The best sorting algorithm is 'sortarray_builtin()'
    With total time=0.004 seconds for array size=250 and 50 iterations.
