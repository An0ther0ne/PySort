# PySort
Testing perfomance of classic sorting algorithms in Python and built in.
# Synopsis
    python SortTest.py
# Files:
[SortTest.py](SortTest.py)
# Requirements
* Python 3.x
* NumPy
# Output
+++ Case 01:

		This is built in Python sort function
		Sorting tests : 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20, Passed.
		Time elapsed: 0.002 seconds.

+++ Case 02:

		Bubble sorting algorithm -- is a simplest of sorting algorithms.
		Perfomance: O(n**2)
        	Sorting tests : 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20, Passed.
		Time elapsed: 1.299 seconds.

+++ Case 03:

		Cocktail shaker sorting alogorithm -- improoved bubble sort
		Perfomance: O(n**2)
		The sample code was taken from here: https://cutt.ly/qrxDTBr
		Sorting tests : 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20, Passed.
		Time elapsed: 1.550 seconds.

+++ Case 04:
		
		Insertion sorting algorithm -- standard realisation
		Perfomance: O(n**2)
		Sorting tests : 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20, Passed.
		Time elapsed: 0.598 seconds.

+++ Case 05:

		Insertion sorting algorithm -- my custom Python-specific realisation
		Perfomance: O(n**2)
		The best performance time among insertions algorithms in python
		Sorting tests : 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20, Passed.
		Time elapsed: 0.136 seconds.

+++ Case 06:

		Gnome sorting algorithm
		Perfomance: O(n**2)
		Sorting tests : 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20, Passed.
		Time elapsed: 1.383 seconds.

+++ S U M A R Y +++

		The best sorting algorithm is 'sortarray_builtin()'
		With total time=0.002 seconds for array size=500 and 20 iterations.
